# about-me

A guessing game about me
---

- As a developer, I want to ask for the userâ€™s name, so that I can personalize reponses.
- As a developer, I want to provide 5 questions to the user, so that they can guess the answers and get to know me.
- As a developer, I want to let the user know if their response was correct or incorrect.
- As a developer, I want to add a sixth question to my guessing game that takes numeric input and prompts the user to guess a random number.
- As a developer, I want to add a seventh question to my guessing game that has multiple possible correct answers that are stored in an array.
- As a developer, I want to keep a tally of the total number of correct answers given by the user, and at the end of the game, tell the user how well they did with a personalized message.
